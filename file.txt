In a non-symmetric matrix, the Eigenvalues are not-repated, then we may not be possible to get linearly independent Eigenvectors. If we form a linearly independent sets of independent sets of Eigenvectors is possible through similarity transformation. 
SYMMETRIC MATRIX 
       If a square A is symmetric, then A = AT
